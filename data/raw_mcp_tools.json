      "description": "Call any Actor from the Apify Store using a mandatory two-step workflow.\nThis ensures you first get the Actor’s input schema and details before executing it safely.\n\nThere are two ways to run Actors:\n1. Dedicated Actor tools (e.g., apify-slash-rag-web-browser): These are pre-configured tools, offering a simpler and more direct experience.\n2. Generic call-actor tool (call-actor): Use this when a dedicated tool is not available or when you want to run any Actor dynamically. This tool is especially useful if you do not want to add specific tools or your client does not support dynamic tool registration.\n\n**Important:**\n\nTypically, a successful run returns a `datasetId` (the Actor's output stored as an Apify dataset) and a short preview of items.\nTo fetch the full output, use the get-actor-output tool with the `datasetId`.\n\nUSAGE:\n- Always use dedicated tools when available (e.g., apify-slash-rag-web-browser)\n- Use the generic call-actor tool only if a dedicated tool does not exist for your Actor.\n\nMANDATORY TWO-STEP-WORKFLOW:\nStep 1: Get Actor Info (step=\"info\", default)\n- First call this tool with step=\"info\" to get Actor details and input schema\n- This returns the Actor description, documentation, and required input schema\n- You MUST do this step first - it's required to understand how to call the Actor\n\nStep 2: Call Actor (step=\"call\")\n- Only after step 1, call this tool again with step=\"call\" and proper input based on the schema\n- This runs the Actor. It will create an output as an Apify dataset (with datasetId).\n- This step returns a dataset preview, typically JSON-formatted tabular data.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n- user_input: Get instagram posts using apify/instagram-scraper",

ALWAYS look up the chat history and provide as much context as possible in the 'query' parameter.\n    Ask for more details when the tool returns this error message 'Common queries will not be generated'.\n    The generated designs are design candidates for users to select from.\n    Ask for a preferred design and use 'create-design-from-candidate' tool to add the design to users' account.\n    The IDs in the URLs are not design IDs.

Do not wait until you have complete requirements.\n  - Once a plan is in progress, stay in the Q&A flow until completion. If the user asks for clarification or advice (e.g., \"what's best for me?\"), answer them, then continue with the plan. Only exit early if the user explicitly requests it or the tool returns an unrecoverable error.\n  - When the tool returns type=\"question\", present the question to the user exactly as provided.\n\nPARAMETERS:\n  - plan_id (optional): Required for continuing/updating. Omit when starting new plan.\n  - answer (required): For new plans, provide summary. For existing plans, provide user response. Accepts option selections ('Option 1'), natural language, clarifying questions, or 'UNKNOWN'.\n  - notes (optional):\n      Technical context you've observed (e.g., \"Python/Flask backend\", \"user wants minimal code to go live quickly\", \"already has Stripe SDK installed\").\n\nReturns JSON:\n  - type=\"question\": Plan in progress.

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

      "description": "Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use this agent to perform the search for you.\n\n- Agents do not run async or in the background, you will wait for the agent's result.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",
