If you provide fields, only those fields will be included (nested fields supported via dot notation).\n\nYou can obtain the datasetId from an Actor run (e.g., after calling an Actor with the call-actor tool) or from the Apify Console (Runs → Run details → Dataset ID).\n\nUSAGE:\n- Use when you need to read Actor output data (full items or selected fields), especially when preview does not include all fields.\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- user_input: Get data of my last Actor run\n- user_input: Get number_of_likes from my dataset\n- user_input: Return only crawl.statusCode and url from dataset aab123\n\nNote: This tool is automatically included if the Apify MCP Server is configured with any Actor tools (e.g., \"apify-slash-rag-web-browser\") or tools that can interact with Actors (e.g., \"call-actor\", \"add-actor\")."

Accepts option selections ('Option 1'), natural language, clarifying questions, or 'UNKNOWN'.\n  - notes (optional):\n      Technical context you've observed (e.g., \"Python/Flask backend\", \"user wants minimal code to go live quickly\", \"already has Stripe SDK installed\").\n\nReturns JSON:\n  - type=\"question\": Plan in progress. Contains `question` to present to user and `plan_id` to include in next call.\n  - type=\"summary\": plan_id, status, summary (blueprints, prerequisites, sample_code)\n  - type=\"error\": status, error (code, message, user_visible, agent_guidance)\n\nWORKFLOW:\n  - New plan: Call without plan_id + answer → Present question EXACTLY → Get answer → Call with plan_id + answer → Repeat\n  - Continue plan: Present question EXACTLY → Analyze code → Formulate answer → Get approval → Call with plan_id + answer + notes → Repeat\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n  - Generates integration guidance only; does not execute code or create Stripe resources.\n  - Cannot modify completed or expired plans—start a new plan instead.\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent"
